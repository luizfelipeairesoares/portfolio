Small portfolio app. Mostly used for showcasing my skills and studying. 

The goal is to update it constantly, adding improvements as I have time. 

This app uses [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/docs) to fetch Marvel's Characters and list them. 

# History 

## January 2025
You can see the Characters in a list, tap in one of them to see a detail view, search and see a list of Comics they appear in.

### Improvements I want to work on this month
- Update test cases and improve code coverage to at least 70%.
- ~~Improve UI/UX adding a Splash screen.~~ :white_check_mark:
- Use Protocols for dependency injection.
